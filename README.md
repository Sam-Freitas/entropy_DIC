# entropy_DIC
Using a 2D entropy filter to segment DIC (Differential Interference Contrast) imaging of cells

This is a simple cell segmentation (isolation) algorithm that is able to segment masses of Differential Interference Contrast (DIC).

Our implementation is for scratch assay analysis (ref: https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2007.30)

### usage: MATLAB

* Read and change the settings if necessary in /scripts/entropy_fil.m
* Run
```
entropy_fil.m
```
